Xcal announcement plugin. This plugin reads xcal feeds generated by
the Pentabarf conference planning system (http://www.pentabarf.org)
and posts the events in IRC channels. Simply load the plugin, have
your bot join the channels you want the announcements to be posted to,
and issue:

!help xcal addevent

This should explain everything. ;-)

After you've added conferences, you can change individual settings by using the
supybot registry system. Simply do

!config supybot.plugins.xcal.events.$(EVENT_SHORT_NAME).$(SETTING) NEW_VALUE
