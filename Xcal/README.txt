Xcal announcement plugin. This plugin reads xcal feeds generated by
the Pentabarf conference planning system (http://www.pentabarf.org)
and posts the events in IRC channels. Simply load the plugin, have
your bot join the channels you want the announcements to be posted to,
and issue:

!help xcal addevent

This should explain everything. ;-)

After you've added conferences, you can change individual settings by using the
supybot registry system. Simply do

!config supybot.plugins.xcal.events.$(EVENT_SHORT_NAME).$(SETTING) NEW_VALUE

=== COPIED FROM PENTABARF.ORG WIKI ===

There's a supybot plugin which can be used to announce talks and events in an
IRC channel. It was first used at the MetaRheinMain Chaosdays 111b.
Announcements look like this:

  <mrmcdinfo> ==> Gleich fuer euch auf den mrmcds: mrmcd111b closing event von
  g0ph3r, Risktaker und Jonas Lerch -- mrmcd111b closing event- what happened and
  have a nice trip home -- Diese Veranstaltung findet in Raum C205 statt. --
  Beginn: 17:30; Dauer: 30 Minuten

To use the plugin, you need to install supybot first, and set up a bot. (Refer
to the supybot website for information on how to do this) The Xcal plugin, as
the name indicates, gets the event information from the xcal version of the
pentabarf schedule.

To set up Xcal, you have to copy it into the supybot plugin directory, then
load it:

  /msg $(NAME_OF_YOUR_BOT) Load Xcal

Next, make sure your bot is joined in the channel you want the announcements to
be posted. Then issue in this channel:

  !addevent mrmcd http://www.hcesperer.org/temp/mrmcdtmp.txt 1800 600 Metarheinmain Chaosdays 111b

Where mrmcd is a short name for your conference,
http://www.hcesperer.org/temp/mrmcdtmp.txt is the (publicly accessibly) URL to
your xcal schedule, 1800 the xcal refresh interval, 600 the number of seconds
to announce an event in advance, and Metarheinmain Chaosdays 111b is the full
title of the conference.

You may add multiple conferences.

If you want to change settings, use the supybot registry system. For example,
to change the xcal url to http://foo.bar/xcal.txt, issue

  /msg $(NAME_OF_YOUR_BOT) config supybot.plugins.Xcal.events.mrmcd.url http://foo.bar/xcal.txt

To change the announce message, use the variable
supybot.plugins.Xcal.events.$(YOUR_EVENT_NAME).announcemsg .

You can checkout the current codebase here:

  git clone http://www.hcesperer.org/supybot/supybotplugins.git

Or, you fetch the current tarball:

  http://www.hcesperer.org/supybot/Xcal.tar.bz2

If you want to test the plugin, you may want to set up a test irc server. You
may use my zero-configuration python ircd for that purpose.
